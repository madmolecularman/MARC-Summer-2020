## Step 1: Meet with coordinators and discuss the following:
Useful resource; **"Identifying the Difficulties with Difficult Ideas"**

1. List the most important concepts and skill introduced in this topic
    a. Concepts
      * You will be using the CV for the rest of your academic career to communicate your interests, experiences, accolades, and other facets of your scholarly achievements to potential schools, jobs, and some professions
      * CV is academic work, Academic resume is a fusion of your academic work and job experience in total
      * Paralellism: keeping a consistent structure to your phrases and/or sentences throughout your document
      * Gapping: use of incomplete sentences in order to present you information as clearly and concisely as possible
      
    b. Skills
      * Generating a good format for your CV
      * Using the proper language to describe research interests and experiences
      * Deciding what to include on your CV or academic resume

2. Which concepts and skills can be the most challenging for researchers this week? Why?

a) Using descriptive language for their research positions
b) Developing a consistent style and structure throughout the document
c) Gapping

## Step 2: Plan your session based on who is attending in the lecture and meeting with the instructor
When planning your sessions remember to stay flexible with the actual implementation of your session plan. Trainees may come prepared with their own questions and agenda. Stay open to their requests. Useful handouts; **Bloom's Taxonomy, Learning Outcome ABC's, S.M.A.R.T, Strategy Du Jour.**

1. **Session Learning Objectives**
Describe what you would like to see your trainees be able to do by the end of your sessions? Use the list of concepts and skills you identified in Step #1. 

I would like trainees to develop at minimum an outline of their CV or academic resume. If trainees have developed a CV before I would like them to add their current summer research and review the foramtting they have for their CV. Additionally the language you use to decribe your position should be active and specific. The concepts of parralellism and gapping is important to consider.

2. **Check-in**
Allow for a 10-20 minute period where trainees are able to communicate with coordinators and each other about the weeks goals, trials, and tribulations.

Updates from these three questions:

Travel grants: Yes absolutely apply for travel grants. Just be aware that there is most likely going to be complications and inconsistencies with travel for the rest of this year. Also, be transparent in your application about you being a MARC trainee. 

Timesheets: Niall and Bryan are going to be checking in with you individually about your responsibilities moving forward. The necessary information for timesheets are: submit monthly lab logs and these are signed by your faculty mentor and then sent to Niall and Bryan.

Pay: I am still waiting to hear from barbara. Have you heard from her this past week?

ASM webinar:
Specifically for ABRCMS: July 31st and August 5th
Student travel: August 20th
Abstract: Sept 11th

It has been difficult
No matter what research experience you can show your scientific prowess
Lack of research or clinical experiences
Absence from your science
Lack of mentorship
Limits to practicing

Your abstract quality is not completely defined by the quality or amount of research. It is defined by developing a compelling argument. 

Format/structure:
Use a funnel approach to your introduction
Describe methods
Map results back to the methods
Conclusion

References : don't add them (Previous research)
No paraphrase, no quoting
It is your single interpretation of the field for the purpose and introduction
For methods and the like you want to be general enough for a lay person to understand this work.
The abstract should flow logically, use the given structure, and the reader can tell where you are going
More concerned about your ability to communicate your science and not the impact of your science
You want to describe in broad terms what has been done in the field.
Can have some reference to the work. 
Stay broad and use qualifiers with your conclusions if you don't have significant results.


Answer specific question from last week:
1) How do abstracts different from an introduction?
Abtracts differ from an introduction in that they include every aspect of your research not just the background. Each abstract will have a background, research question, material and methods, data/results, and a conclusion.

2) What is the appropriate level with audience not using jargon? 
The easiest way to gauge this is three fold. I would first read and review the papers that your research is founded on. The language conventions and strategies those papers use you can emulate. That doesn't mean you can't be creative in this approach, but you can use these as guidelines. The second way is to review abstract submissions from previous conferences. Most student focused conferences will have previous year submissions available. Lastly, if the organization runs workshops attend them. They will give you some guidance on the type of language. 

3) Use reference/citation?
The typical convention is to not use references or citations. If you need to references process's think about whether you can use the common name for that process or if it is so specfic using in text citation. 

4) what parts of your research to include? 
You will include background research/literature review, research question you came up with, hypothesis for your experiment, methods used for your experiment, data obtained, outcome of data and trends, and broader conclusion from your work.

5) Detail for materials and methods?
This is a hard balance. You do not want to get down into the weeds when describing your materials and methods. There are ways to be brief but specific when defining your methods. Remember you have at max 2 -3 sentences for each section. Use that space wisely.

Lets check-in: What has this week brought about for you all? Good things, challenging things, concerns?

3. **Warm-up**
Describe a 10-15 minute opportunity that will help trainees to organize, prioritize, define, identify, label, list, record, or review, ideas.

I'd like you to list your experiences within these categories with location and dates:
Research Interests
Research Experience
Education and Professional Experience
Leadership opportunities
Honors & Awards
Coursework
Service

4. **Most of the session time**
Describe how you will utilize the meeting activity (50-60 minutes) to help trainees achieve the learning objectives you have developed.

Discussion:
What is a curriculum vita?
Curriculum Vita vs. Resume?
What is an Academic Resume?
Whatâ€™s in a CV?
What should NOT be in a CV?
Within the CV, how should the descriptions be constructed?

Activity:
We are going to develop and outline for a CV or academic resume.

5. **Wrap-up**
Describe a 10-15 minute closing opportunity that will help trainees summarize their work in today's session. 

Reflect on what to move from the want to know category to the learn category or add things that you learned. What else do you still want to know or feel like we have not addressed?

## Step 3: Reflect on this week's session
Once you have hosted the session and completed the reflection share your completed session plan with your coordinators and review all of the activites from that week.

**1. What worked in the session? What was successful?**

**2. What did trainees learn? How do you know?**

**3. What would you change about your session today?**

**4. What specific content areas and study strategies did you recommend that trainees pursue before next week's sessions?**

**5. What are you considering as good use of next week's session?**
