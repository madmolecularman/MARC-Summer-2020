## MARC Summer Support 2020

This respositry is developed by Jacob Green to organize and support MARC students over the Summer of 2020. I will be scheduling meetings, planning sessions, and other resources through this directory. If you have any questions please reach out to me at here gree9242@uri.edu. 

### Description
MARC summer meetings support studentsâ€™ research experiences, strengthens research and professional skills, and helps prepare them for graduate school.

There are 3 areas that MARC coordinators be providing guidance for MARC trainees. 

1) Summer research discussions
2) Professional development
3) Computational Support

### Summer research discussions
These meetings are meant to provide a platform for MARC trainees to discuss their ideas, triumphs, and concerns over their summer research program. Meetings will last from and 1.5 to 2 hours. The typical meeting will be outlined as follows:

* Check-in (10-20 minutes)
* Warm-up (10-20 minutes)
* Meeting activity (50-60 minutes)
* Wrap-up (20 minutes)

Check-ins will give scholars the opportunity to update coordinators about what is going on in their programs and how they are doing.

Warm-up's are meant to help students organize, prioritize, and record their ideas.

Meeting activities will vary depending on the goals of the session and what trainees would like to accomplish. They will generally fall into two categories: 1) professional development 2) programming and bioinformatic work. Professional development will be focused on preparing for graduate school applications, finding funding opportunities, writing research abstracts, communicating research, and CV/academic resume building. Programming and bioinformatic work will focus on gaining the necessary skills through a bioinformatics project. This will be outlined elsewhere, but we will be taking a [CURE](https://www.hhmi.org/science-education/programs/model-programs-course-based-undergraduate-research-experience-cre-or-cure) based approach to learning these skills. 

Wrap-up's will be a closing opportunity that will help scholars summarize what work was accomplished in the meeting session and to clarify any support they need moving forward.
